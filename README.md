# Task_Signup
 **Login page**
 
With the help of react,node,express and Mongodb created the fromt end an backend for the application since this is a signup page all the responses are supposed to be stored in the databse and thus I have used the post function for it the Mongo database was workin fine before the integration of the frontend but after the integration it ius returning an empty json object '{ }' like this.
 
 I have attached the Screenshots of the issue I have been facing.


## File structure and composition

### Backend
The application listen in the server.js file -> Task_Signup/signupbackend/server.js file and the folder contains the model(Task_Signup/signupbackend/models/) and routes(Task_Signup/signupbackend/routes/) schema in it.

### Frontend
The application integration is done in the App.jsx file -> Task_Signup/src/App.jsx.
