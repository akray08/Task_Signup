# Task_Signup
 **Login page**
 
With the help of react,node,express and Mongodb created the fromt end an backend for the application since this is a signup page all the responses are supposed to be stored in the databse and thus I have used the post function for it the Mongo database was workin fine before the integration of the frontend but after the integration it ius returning an empty json object '{ }' like this.
 
 I have attached the Screenshots of the issue I have been facing.
